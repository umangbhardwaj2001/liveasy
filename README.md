# This is an API build to serve the load

To test this API in your local machine make sure to install node.js and npm then run following commands

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

then use postman for HTTP methods

> here I have used get, post, put, and delete methods along with paramenters

or you can directly paste this [API LINK](https://b-liveasy.herokuapp.com/) in postman and perform the HTTP methods
